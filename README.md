# Rust Lighter

This project was started as my RUST exercise to abstract the Rust Candle framework (https://github.com/huggingface/candle)  and introduce a more convenient way of programming neural network machine learning models. The behaviour is inspired by Python KERAS (https://keras.io) and based on the Rust-Keras-like (https://github.com/AhmedBoin/Rust-Keras-Like).

The Rust Candle ecosystem facilitates terms that refer to candles &#128367;. So let's call the project **Rust Lighter**, because it helps to turn on the candle light and is even easier to implement.

An example can be foudn below *src/main.rs*.
