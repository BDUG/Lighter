# Rust Lighter

This project was started as my RUST exercise to abstract the CANDLE (https://github.com/huggingface/candle) framework and introduce a more convenient way of programming neural network machine learning models. The behaviour is inspired by Python KERAS (https://keras.io) and based on the Rust-Keras-like (https://github.com/AhmedBoin/Rust-Keras-Like).

The CANDLE ecosystem facilitates terms that refer to candles. So let's call the project LIGHTER, because it helps to turn on the light and is even easier to implement.

Note: It is by far not production ready and is only used for training purposes.
